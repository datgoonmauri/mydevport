        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Mauricio Alvarado, I am 25 years young. I’ve been married to my Wife (she is also a Developer) for 5 years and together we have a wonderful son. I’ve always loved technology and thrived off puzzles and solving problems as a kid growing up in California’s Bay Area. I have an incredible curiosity for how things work and are made. In addition to that I feel learning is a key component in my life and to the way I approach many things and it has led me to where I am now.  


        </p>
        <p>
          I am a self-motivated and progress-driven Full Stack Web Developer with an eager necessity to contribute to the tech industry. I am incredibly adaptable and dynamic in and out of the workplace. I believe my conscientious and adept approach to programming will bring value to the company that decides to take me on as a part of their team. The reason I’m so passionately pursuing this role is that I feel it perfectly aligns with my skills and interests. Which I believe will help me achieve the most fulfillment in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          After many hours, days, and months of hard work, team collaboration, learning concepts, reading documentation, working with a scrum/agile team, after building many projects, using many frameworks the time I spent obtaining my certification from Kenzie Academy, has honed my skills and ability to be a Software Engineer. I believe I am an astute problem-solver capable of prioritizing and managing complex projects with proficiency. I exercised skills in critical thinking, observation and technical support and consistently contributed to team efforts and improvements. I am open-minded and focused on new developments in my field. I have proven to be effective and versatile, with proficiency in teamwork and collaborative work. I enjoy brainstorming and coordinating efforts to achieve a common goal
